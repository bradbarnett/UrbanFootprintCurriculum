Analysis Modules Overview
-------------------------

.. image:: graphics/AnalysisModules_overview.png

Analysis modlues are generally run following the completion of a scenario, or at "break points" within the development of a scenaro to evaluate how the scenario is performing. Some of these analytical modules take a few minutes to run and as such aren't something that is run following every change to the scenario.

As shown in the image above, many of the analytical modules are connected to each other. For example, several of the analytical modules use outputs generated by running the transportation analytical module. 


Land Consumption
----------------

UrbanFootprint identifies the amount of greenfield land consumed based on the base case, and then evaluates that new consumption against environmental constraint, agricultural, or other defined land types.

*Figure LC 1: The Land Consumption Measurement Process*

.. image:: graphics/AM_LandConsumption.png

As a spatial model, UrbanFootprint produces fine-grained assessments of how land is developed or consumed in a future scenario. In the context of the model, “land consumption” refers to the
measurement of land area needed to accommodate new growth. This includes ‘greenfield’ development on previously undeveloped land, and refill (infill and redevelopment) growth in existing urban areas.
Land consumption calculations for future scenarios are built upon an assessment of the base (existing) environment. The base data loading process assigns to each grid cell descriptors of its land type
conditions, which are used to describe how new growth impacts the landscape; whether it will consume new land as greenfield development, intensify or modify existing urban areas as refill development, or
be excluded from development by environmental, conservation, or policy constraints. For a future scenario, UrbanFootprint analyzes the extent of land use change and maps the area of greenfield land as
well as areas of previously urbanized land (refill development) required to accommodate new residential and employment growth (see Figure LC 1).



Land Consumption Inputs
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The Land Consumption analysis accounts for consumed land by intersecting scenario ‘change areas’ with  an assessment of land cover in the base environment. The assessment of land cover in the base  environment can be as detailed or as general as the user and data allows. UrbanFootprint can analyze  growth impacts on a variety of specific land types (i.e. specific types of agricultural lands, forest or range  lands, or other lands of specific interest), provided that the existing environment is described in  adequate detail. For UrbanFootprint version 1.0, the land consumption module defines land types via a  land type reference dataset compiled from data derived from the California Farmland Mapping and  Monitoring Program (FMMP) and California Protected Areas Database (CPAD) datasets. The land type  reference dataset provides a base year assessment of urban, greenfield, and constrained lands, from  which land consumption can be calculated.

Land Consumption Methodology
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In UrbanFootprint version 1.0, land consumption is defined as the conversion of base year greenfield (undeveloped) land to urban uses. In order for newly-urban change areas to be counted as land  consumed, they must have a residential density greater than 0.5 dwelling unit per acre, and/or an  employment density of greater than 1 employee per acre.  The general process for calculating land consumption in UrbanFootprint version 1.0 is detailed in the  following steps:  Step 1: Join the land type dataset to the net increment table. The land type grid is joined to the net  increment table on their primary keys.  Step 2. Quantify greenfield land consumption using change area definition. To identify where in a new  scenario land consumption occurs, change grid cells are identified through a filtering process. Change  grid cells are identified by whether they are allocated growth via a place type and have greater than 0.5  dwelling units per acre or greater than 1 employee per acre. To identify grid cells that include greenfield  land consumption, change grid cells are further filtered by whether their developable greenfield acreage  is greater than their urban acreage. If there is more developable greenfield acreage than urban, a grid  cell is considered greenfield. Otherwise, it is flagged as containing refill growth. Greenfield land  consumption is then calculated by summing greenfield grid cells in a scenario, as described in the equation below.

Building Energy Use
-------------------

.. image:: graphics/AM_BuildingEnergy.png

Each building type in UrbanFootprint consumes a baseline amount of energy based on its location and designated policy factors.  Residential energy use is computed based on each dwelling unit, by type, and commercial by their square footage by usage (i.e. retail, office, industrial…).

The location determines which climate zone the building is in, and that determines the baseline energy consumption. 

Baseline energy consumption is assumed to be fixed with the exception of an incremental improvement in efficiency over time.  Buildings present in at the base line year, can have a rate of retrofitting or replacement (with the same building type) which improve those building’s energy efficiency.

New buildings constructed through the scenario have policy driven baseline improvements in energy efficiency and then are also subject to rates of retrofitting and replacement. 

Energy policy options are implemented through applying rates of improvement in baseline efficiency to buildings that are either new construction or are retrofitted, with new construction (or major retrofits) being a full update to the projected energy efficiency at the time of construction and retrofits being a significant improvement over the baseline efficiency that the building had prior to retrofit.

After generating total energy used, assumed costs for electricity and natural gas can be applied allowing the calculation of energy costs.

Water Use
---------

* Water impacts follow a very similar path to Energy.
* Building type and climate zone determine water used both indoor and outdoor
* Indoor water usage is estimated per-capita by building type
* Outdoor water usage is estimated per square foot of irrigated outdoor space adjusted by the climate zone.

Local Fiscal Impacts
--------------------

Fiscal impact analysis divides the build landscape across two axes. Urban, compact, or standard developments (Land Development Class or LDC) and refill or greenfield construction.

Urban is high density development characterized by city centers
Compact is a highly walkable, mixed use urban form
Standard includes most suburban, auto-oriented construction.
 
Infrastructure costs are calculated per residential unit by type, LDC, and greenfield or refill type  [and per square foot of commercial by type] Need clarification. Infrastructure costs are assumed to be a one time cost. And include the installation of transportation, water, and wastewater facilities.

Operations & Maintenance costs are long term infrastrucutre related costs assessed over time on a per residential unit basis by building type and LDC. 

Local Renues include the projected property tax, property transfer, and vehicle license fees based on the building type and LDC. I.e. Urban areas have lower vehicle ownership and the estimates reflect that in the vehicle license fees. 

Transportation
--------------

.. image:: graphics/AM_Transportation.png

Transportation is the most complex of the analytical modules and may require a half hour or more to run. 

Put simply, UrbanFootprint builds a picture of the land use and accessibility surrounding each housing unit and applies an enhanced version of the MXD model developed by Fehr & Peers with EPA funding (http://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/mxd_tripgeneration.html) to appropriately scale per capita VMT estimates drawn from a local transportation model up or down as the land use mixture changes. 

These results are then fed into a secondary model that applies projections of future vehicle fleet mixtures and efficiencies to obtain estimates of the quantity and types of energy used to power the fleet, the number and length of trips made, the pollutants emitted, and the costs both for fuel and vehicle O & M.

The results from the Transportation module have matched very well with MPO travel models. It is important to note that this requires careful calibration to achieve.

The results from the Transport Module can be displayed visually and in tabular forms. For example these results are from the Vision California project by Calthorpe Associates and display VMT per household for the Sacramento Area Council of Governments' 2035 land use projections with accompanying info graphic showing a comparison of two scenarios.

Household Costs
---------------

.. image:: graphics/AM_HouseholdCosts.png

Based on the costs estimated per unit for energy and water use, as well as vehicle fuel costs, total household costs are calculated.

Public Health
-------------

.. image:: graphics/AM_PublicHealth.png

The public health module builds on the transportation model as well as the baseline scenario.  Demographic assumptions combined with the local environment are used to forecast the amount of time spent in moderate and vigorous activity, proportion of the population that is overweight, and time spent in cars. These are then used to identify the incidence of weight and activity related diseases and resulting costs.

The transportation engine provides estimates of VMT and pollutants which are used to estimate pedestrian-auto collisions and respiratory illnesses, and the related costs from each.
