Goals
-----
* Review the Analysis Modules and How they work
* We will be covering calibration and customization only lightly

Analysis Modules Overview
-------------------------

.. image:: graphics/AnalysisModules_overview.png

Analysis modlues are generally run following the completion of a scenario, or at "break points" within the development of a scenaro to evaluate how the scenario is performing. Some of these analytical modules take a few minutes to run and as such aren't something that is run following every change to the scenario.

As shown in the image above, many of the analytical modules are connected to each other. For example, several of the analytical modules use outputs generated by running the transportation analytical module. 


Land Consumption
----------------

UrbanFootprint identifies the amount of greenfield and refill land consumed in the scenario.

*Figure LC 1: The Land Consumption Measurement Process*

.. image:: graphics/AM_LandConsumption.png

It does this by using a dataset to divide the entire landscape into greenfield and developed space, this has been done in the past using the FMMP.

Each polygon then has a percentage of it's land area that is developable greenfield space and developable "refill" space. The polygon is then analyzed so that if it has more developable greenfield space than refill any development in the polygon is considered greenfield consumption and if there is more developable refill space than greenfield any development is considered refill. The total acrage of greenfield and refill development is then calculated across the entire scenario.

Building Energy Use
-------------------

.. image:: graphics/AM_BuildingEnergy.png

Each building type in UrbanFootprint consumes a baseline amount of energy based on its location and designated policy factors.  Residential energy use is computed based on each dwelling unit, by type, and commercial by their square footage by usage (i.e. retail, office, industrial…).

The location determines which climate zone the building is in, and that determines the baseline energy consumption. 

Baseline energy consumption is assumed to be fixed with the exception of an incremental improvement in efficiency over time.  Buildings present in at the base line year, can have a rate of retrofitting or replacement (with the same building type) which improve those building’s energy efficiency.

New buildings constructed through the scenario have policy driven baseline improvements in energy efficiency and then are also subject to rates of retrofitting and replacement. 

Energy policy options are implemented through applying rates of improvement in baseline efficiency to buildings that are either new construction or are retrofitted, with new construction (or major retrofits) being a full update to the projected energy efficiency at the time of construction and retrofits being a significant improvement over the baseline efficiency that the building had prior to retrofit.

After generating total energy used, assumed costs for electricity and natural gas can be applied allowing the calculation of energy costs.

Water Use
---------

* Water impacts follow a very similar path to Energy.
* Building type and climate zone determine water used both indoor and outdoor
* Indoor water usage is estimated per-capita by building type
* Outdoor water usage is estimated per square foot of irrigated outdoor space adjusted by the climate zone.

Local Fiscal Impacts
--------------------

Fiscal impact analysis divides the build landscape across two axes. Urban, compact, or standard developments (Land Development Class or LDC) and refill or greenfield construction.

Urban is high density development characterized by city centers
Compact is a highly walkable, mixed use urban form
Standard includes most suburban, auto-oriented construction.
 
Infrastructure costs are calculated per residential unit by type, LDC, and greenfield or refill type  [and per square foot of commercial by type] Need clarification. Infrastructure costs are assumed to be a one time cost. And include the installation of transportation, water, and wastewater facilities.

Operations & Maintenance costs are long term infrastrucutre related costs assessed over time on a per residential unit basis by building type and LDC. 

Local Renues include the projected property tax, property transfer, and vehicle license fees based on the building type and LDC. I.e. Urban areas have lower vehicle ownership and the estimates reflect that in the vehicle license fees. 

Transportation
--------------

.. image:: graphics/AM_Transportation.png

Transportation is the most complex of the analytical modules and may require a half hour or more to run. 

Put simply, UrbanFootprint builds a picture of the land use and accessibility surrounding each housing unit and applies an enhanced version of the MXD model developed by Fehr & Peers with EPA funding (http://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/mxd_tripgeneration.html) to appropriately scale per capita VMT estimates drawn from a local transportation model up or down as the land use mixture changes. 

These results are then fed into a secondary model that applies projections of future vehicle fleet mixtures and efficiencies to obtain estimates of the quantity and types of energy used to power the fleet, the number and length of trips made, the pollutants emitted, and the costs both for fuel and vehicle O & M.

The results from the Transportation module have matched very well with MPO travel models. It is important to note that this requires careful calibration to achieve.

The results from the Transport Module can be displayed visually and in tabular forms. For example these results are from the Vision California project by Calthorpe Associates and display VMT per household for the Sacramento Area Council of Governments' 2035 land use projections with accompanying info graphic showing a comparison of two scenarios.

Household Costs
---------------

.. image:: graphics/AM_HouseholdCosts.png

Based on the costs estimated per unit for energy and water use, as well as vehicle fuel costs, total household costs are calculated.

Public Health
-------------

.. image:: graphics/AM_PublicHealth.png

The public health module builds on the transportation model as well as the baseline scenario.  Demographic assumptions combined with the local environment are used to forecast the amount of time spent in moderate and vigorous activity, proportion of the population that is overweight, and time spent in cars. These are then used to identify the incidence of weight and activity related diseases and resulting costs.

The transportation engine provides estimates of VMT and pollutants which are used to estimate pedestrian-auto collisions and respiratory illnesses, and the related costs from each.
